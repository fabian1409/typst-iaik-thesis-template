  acknowledgments: [
    I want to take this opportunity to thank my supervisors, especially Fabian Schmid, who answered countless questions and gave me valuable feedback during the last year.

    Furthermore, I want to thank Franco Nieddu, who inspired me to take on this topic and helped me when I was stuck with a particular problem or design choice during development.

    Finally, I want to thank everyone who supported me during my studies and while working on this thesis.
